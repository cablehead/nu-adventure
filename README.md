# Nathelina & Annika's `nu` Adventure Game

Hello Nathelina and Annika!

You are walking through a green forest. The air is fresh, and the sun is
shining. You can hear the birds singing and the leaves rustling in the wind.

You have come to a clearing in the forest.

What do you want to do?

Available commands:

- `ls` - to look around
- `open <object>` - to look inside things
- `grab <object> <thing>` - to take things out of objects
- `inventory` - to see what you are carrying

Type your command below and press Enter.

(may I suggest `ls`?)
